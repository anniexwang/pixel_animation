# Product Overview

This is a computer graphics educational project focused on raster image processing and manipulation. It's an assignment from a Computer Graphics course that teaches fundamental image processing operations.

## Core Functionality

The project implements various image processing operations:
- Color space conversions (RGB ↔ grayscale, RGB ↔ HSV)
- Image transformations (reflection, rotation)
- Bayer mosaic simulation and demosaicing
- Color adjustments (hue shift, desaturation)
- Alpha compositing (Porter-Duff Over operator)
- PPM file format writing

## Purpose

This is a learning assignment designed to:
- Get students familiar with C++17/20 and CMake build systems
- Teach fundamental raster image representation and manipulation
- Demonstrate color space conversions and image processing algorithms
- Practice working with multi-dimensional arrays stored in linear memory
